# Non-AI Exercises

## 1. Basic R Operations and Variables

### 1.1 Match Data Types

What type of data would each of these variables contain?

a) `vote_count <- 538`
b) `party_name <- "Democratic"`
c) `is_incumbent <- TRUE`
d) `approval_rating <- "45%"`

Options: numeric, character, logical

Answers: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 1.2 Fill in the Blanks: Vector Creation

Complete this code to create a vector of battleground states:

```r

```

Missing states: Florida, Ohio, Michigan


### 1.3 Code Detective: Vector Operations

What does this code do? Explain each line:

```r
poll_results <- c(48, 52, 45, 51, 49)
average_result <- mean(poll_results)
max_result <- max(poll_results)
results_above_50 <- poll_results > 50
```

Line 1: _____
Line 2: _____
Line 3: _____
Line 4: _____

## 2. Understanding Data Frames

### 2.1 Data Frame Structure

When you see this output from `glimpse()`:

```
Rows: 100
Columns: 5
$ candidate     <chr> "Smith", "Jones", "Brown"...
$ party         <chr> "Dem", "Rep", "Dem"...
$ votes         <dbl> 15234, 16789, 14556...
$ district      <int> 1, 1, 2...
$ incumbent     <lgl> TRUE, FALSE, FALSE...
```

Answer these questions:
- How many observations are in this dataset? _____
- How many variables are in this dataset? _____
- What type of data is stored in the `votes` column? _____
- Which column contains TRUE/FALSE values? _____

### 2.2 True or False: Data Frames

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ Data frames can only contain numeric data
_____ Each column in a data frame must have the same length
_____ Rows represent observations, columns represent variables
_____ You can mix different data types in the same column
_____ glimpse() shows you the structure and first few values

## 3. Data Types and Functions

### 3.1 Matching Data Types

Match each data type abbreviation with its meaning:

**Abbreviations:**
a) `<dbl>`
b) `<chr>`
c) `<int>`
d) `<lgl>`
e) `<date>`

**Meanings:**
1. Whole numbers only
2. TRUE/FALSE values
3. Text data
4. Decimal numbers
5. Calendar dates

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____, e = _____

### 3.2 Multiple Choice: Functions

Which function would you use to:

1. See the first 6 rows of data: _____
2. Get column names: _____
3. Get summary statistics: _____
4. See data structure and types: _____
5. Round to 2 decimal places: _____

Options: a) head(), b) names(), c) summary(), d) glimpse(), e) round(x, 2)

## 4. Error Diagnosis

### 4.1 Spot the Error

What's wrong with each code snippet?

```r
# Error 1
Mean(poll_results)

# Error 2
numbers <- c("1", "2", "3")
mean(numbers)

# Error 3
read_csv("data.csv")
```

Error 1 problem: _____
Error 2 problem: _____
Error 3 problem: _____

### 4.2 Multiple Choice: Debugging

In the code below, why does line 2 produce an error?

```r
electoral_votes <- c(20, 16, 10, 11, 16, 6)
average_votes = mean(Electoral_Votes)
```

a) The mean() function doesn't exist
b) Variable names are case-sensitive (electoral_votes â‰  Electoral_Votes)
c) You can't calculate mean of a vector
d) The assignment operator should be <-

Answer: _____
