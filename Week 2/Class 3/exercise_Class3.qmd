# Non-AI Exercises

## 1. Working with Missing Data

### 1.1 The Challenge of Missing Data

Why can't we use `== NA` to check for missing values in R? What does this tell us about how R thinks about missing data?

Answer:

### 1.2 Code Detective: Missing Data

Explain what's wrong with this code and how to fix it:

```r
data %>%
  filter(age == NA)
```

Problem: _____
Solution: _____



## 2. The Pipe Operator

### 2.1 Pipe vs No Pipe

These two pieces of code do the same thing. Which is easier to read and why?

```r
# Version A
arrange(select(filter(congress, party_code == "Republican"), bioname, nominate_dim1), nominate_dim1)

# Version B  
congress %>%
  filter(party_code == "Republican") %>%
  select(bioname, nominate_dim1) %>%
  arrange(nominate_dim1)
```

Answer: _____

## 3. Understanding DW-NOMINATE Scores

### 3.1 The Scale

DW-NOMINATE scores range from -1 to +1. What do these values represent in terms of political ideology? If a member of Congress has a score of -0.8, what does this tell you about their political positions?

Answer:

### 3.2 Interpreting Changes

If the average DW-NOMINATE score for Democrats has moved from -0.3 in 1980 to -0.4 in 2020, what does this suggest about the party? What about if Republicans moved from +0.3 to +0.5?

Answer:

## 4. Advanced Tidyverse Operations

### 4.1 The %in% Operator

Explain what this code does and when you would use the `%in%` operator instead of `==`:

```r
congress %>%
  filter(state_abbrev %in% c("CA", "TX", "NY", "FL"))
```

Answer:

### 4.2 Select Helpers

Match each `select()` helper function with what it does:

a) `starts_with("vote")`     1. Selects columns containing "district" anywhere
b) `ends_with("_id")`        2. Selects all remaining columns
c) `contains("district")`     3. Selects columns starting with "vote"
d) `everything()`            4. Selects columns ending with "_id"

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

## 5. Building Complex Analyses

### 5.1 Step-by-Step Approach

Why is it important to build your analysis step by step rather than writing complex chains all at once? Give two specific benefits.

Answer:

## 6. Data Exploration Best Practices

### 6.1 Understanding Your Data

Why is it important to use functions like `count()`, `summary()`, and `glimpse()` before doing complex analysis? What might happen if you skip this step?

Answer:

## 7. The NOT Operator

### 7.1 Using the NOT Operator

What will each of these expressions return if `x = 5` and `y = NA`:

a) `!TRUE` = _____
b) `!(x > 3)` = _____
c) `!is.na(x)` = _____
d) `!is.na(y)` = _____

### 7.2 Practical Application

Write the filter condition to keep only rows where the `vote_share` column is NOT missing:

Answer: `filter(_____)`

## 8. Multiple Sorting

### 8.1 Understanding arrange() with Multiple Variables

What does this code do, and in what order will the results appear?

```r
congress %>%
  arrange(state_abbrev, desc(nominate_dim1))
```

Answer:

# AI Exercises

For each AI exercise:
- Write your prompt in the designated space
- Record Claude's response
- Run the code and document the results

## 9. Congressional Ideology Analysis

**Dataset: HSall_members.csv**

**Description**: DW-NOMINATE scores for all members of Congress throughout history.

**Variables**:
- `congress`: Congress number (int)
- `chamber`: House or Senate (chr)
- `state_abbrev`: State abbreviation (chr)
- `party_code`: Political party (chr)
- `bioname`: Member name (chr)
- `nominate_dim1`: Liberal-conservative score, -1 to 1 (dbl)
- `nominate_dim2`: Second dimension score (dbl)
- `nominate_geo_mean_probability`: Prediction accuracy (dbl)

### 9.1 Loading and Initial Exploration

```{r}
# Load the dataset
congress <- read_csv("Week 2/Class 3/HSall_members.csv")

# Explore the DW-NOMINATE data
glimpse(congress)
```

This dataset contains ideological scores for all members of Congress. Work with Claude to understand what the nominate_dim1 variable represents.

### 9.2 Party Polarization Over Time

Ask Claude to help you analyze how the ideological distance between Democrats and Republicans in the most recent Congress.

**Your Prompt to Claude:**

```{r}

```

### 9.3 State-Level Analysis

Work with Claude to find which state has the most ideologically diverse congressional delegation in the current Congress.

**Your Prompt to Claude:**

```{r}

```

## 10. School Climate and Outcomes

**Dataset: school_climate.csv**

**Description**: Student-level data nested in 500 schools measuring climate, discipline, academics.

**Variables**:
- `student_id`: Unique student identifier (int)
- `school_id`: School identifier (int)
- `grade_level`: 9-12 (int)
- `gender`: male, female, nonbinary (factor)
- `race_ethnicity`: Standard categories (factor)
- `suspensions`: Annual suspension count (int)
- `gpa`: 0-4 scale (num)
- `school_safety`: 0-10 student perception (int)
- `teacher_support`: 0-10 (int)
- `parent_involvement`: 0-10 (int)
- `school_poverty_rate`: % eligible for free lunch (num)

### 10.1 Data Loading and Quality Check

```{r}
# Load the dataset
school <- read_csv("Week 2/Class 3/school_climate.csv")

# Check the structure
glimpse(school)
```

This dataset contains student-level data nested within schools. 

### 10.2 Analyzing Discipline Disparities

Ask Claude to help you look for misssing data.

**Your Prompt to Claude:**

```{r}

```
