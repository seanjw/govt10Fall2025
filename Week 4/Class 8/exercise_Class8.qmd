# Non-AI Exercises

## 1. Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

### 1.1 Multiple Choice: Counterfactuals

What is the fundamental problem of causal inference?

a) We can't measure outcomes accurately
b) We can't observe the same unit under both treatment and control conditions
c) Random assignment is difficult
d) Statistical software has limitations

Answer: _____

### 1.2 Fill in the Blanks: Potential Outcomes

In potential outcomes notation:

1. Y(1) represents the outcome when _____
2. Y(0) represents the outcome when _____
3. The individual causal effect is _____
4. We can only observe _____ of these for each person
5. The unobserved outcome is called a _____

Word bank: treated, not treated, Y(1) - Y(0), one, counterfactual

### 1.3 True or False: Causal Inference

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ We can directly observe individual causal effects
_____ Random assignment helps create comparable groups
_____ The ATE is the average of individual treatment effects
_____ Counterfactuals are hypothetical unobserved outcomes
_____ Causal inference requires observing all potential outcomes

## 2. Average Treatment Effects

### 2.1 Code Detective: ATE Calculation

What does this code calculate?

```r
treatment_group %>%
  summarise(mean_outcome = mean(outcome)) -> treated_mean

control_group %>%
  summarise(mean_outcome = mean(outcome)) -> control_mean

ate <- treated_mean$mean_outcome - control_mean$mean_outcome
```

This calculates: _____

### 2.2 Match: ATE Components

Match each component with its meaning:

**Components:**
a) E[Y(1)]
b) E[Y(0)]
c) E[Y(1) - Y(0)]
d) E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]

**Meanings:**
1. Average treatment effect
2. Expected outcome under treatment
3. Expected outcome under control
4. Observed difference in means

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 2.3 Multiple Choice: Random Assignment

Why does random assignment help identify causal effects?

a) It makes the sample larger
b) It ensures treatment and control groups are similar on average
c) It eliminates all confounders perfectly
d) It makes people more honest

Answer: _____

## 3. Difference-in-Differences

### 3.1 Fill in the Blanks: DiD Logic

Difference-in-differences compares:

1. Changes over time in the _____ group
2. Changes over time in the _____ group
3. The difference between these changes estimates the _____
4. DiD assumes _____ trends without treatment
5. We need at least _____ time periods

Word bank: treatment, control, causal effect, parallel, two

### 3.2  True or False: DiD Assumptions

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ DiD requires random assignment of treatment
_____ Parallel trends assumption means groups move together pre-treatment
_____ DiD can work with observational data
_____ We need panel data for DiD
_____ DiD eliminates all time-invariant confounders

## 4. Validity

### 4.1 Match: Validity Types

Match each validity type with its concern:

**Types:**
a) Internal validity
b) External validity
c) Construct validity
d) Statistical validity

**Concerns:**
1. Whether results generalize to other contexts
2. Whether we can attribute effects to treatment
3. Whether we're measuring what we think
4. Whether statistical tests are appropriate

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 4.2 Multiple Choice: Threats

Which threatens internal validity?

a) Small sample size
b) Selection bias
c) Limited geographic scope
d) Measurement error

Answer: _____

### 4.3 Spot the Error: Causal Claims

What's wrong with this conclusion?

"States that adopted the policy saw crime decrease, so the policy reduced crime."

Problem: _____

# AI Exercises
