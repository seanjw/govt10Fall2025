# Non-AI Exercises

## 1. Three Requirements for Causality

### 1.1 Match: Causal Requirements

Match each requirement with its definition:

**Requirements:**
a) Association
b) Temporal ordering
c) No confounding

**Definitions:**
1. The cause must come before the effect
2. No third variable explains both X and Y
3. X and Y must be statistically related

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

### 1.2 Multiple Choice: Ice Cream and Crime

Why is "ice cream sales cause crime" a spurious correlation?

a) Ice cream and crime are not associated
b) Crime happens before ice cream sales
c) Temperature affects both ice cream sales and crime
d) The correlation is too weak

Answer: _____

### 1.3 True or False: Causation

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ Correlation always implies causation
_____ Causation requires temporal ordering
_____ Large correlations are more likely to be causal
_____ Randomized experiments help establish causation
_____ Observational data can never show causation

## 2. Identifying Confounders

### 2.1 Fill in the Blanks: Confounding

A confounding variable:

1. Affects both the _____ and the _____
2. Creates a _____ relationship between X and Y
3. Must occur _____ to both X and Y
4. Can be controlled through _____ assignment
5. Makes causal inference _____

Word bank: treatment, outcome, spurious, prior, random, difficult

### Match: Examples

Match each scenario with the likely confounding variable:

**Scenarios:**
a) Wealthy people live longer
b) Students with more books at home do better in school
c) Cities with more police have more crime
d) Married people are happier

**Confounders:**
1. Crime rates drive police hiring
2. Access to healthcare
3. Parents' education and income
4. Selection into marriage

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

## 3. Temporal Ordering

### 3.1 Multiple Choice: Time Order

Which scenario violates temporal ordering for causation?

a) Studying causes better grades
b) Rain causes wet streets
c) High crime causes more police hiring last year
d) Tall children have tall parents

Answer: _____

### 3.2 Spot the Error: Causal Claims

What's wrong with this causal claim?

"States with stricter gun laws have more gun violence, so gun laws cause violence."

Problem: _____

## 4. Alternative Explanations

### 4.1 Multiple Choice: Spurious Correlations

The correlation between divorce rate and margarine consumption is likely:

a) Causal - margarine causes divorce
b) Causal - divorce causes margarine consumption
c) Spurious - both follow similar time trends
d) Reversed - the causation goes backwards

Answer: _____

### 4.2 True or False: Research Design

Mark each statement as True (T) or False (F):

_____ Random assignment eliminates all confounders
_____ Large samples guarantee causal inference
_____ Natural experiments can establish causation
_____ Correlation is necessary but not sufficient for causation
_____ Time series data always shows causation

### 4.3 Match: Causal Mechanisms

Match each political example with its mechanism:

**Examples:**
a) Education → Higher income
b) Campaign spending → Votes
c) Media coverage → Public opinion
d) Voting laws → Turnout

**Mechanisms:**
1. Increased name recognition
2. Skills and credentials
3. Agenda setting and framing
4. Access and convenience

Matches: a = _____, b = _____, c = _____, d = _____

# AI Exercises
