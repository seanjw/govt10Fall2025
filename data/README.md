## Data Generation

All synthetic datasets are created by the `generate_basic_datasets.R` script. This script:
- Uses realistic parameter values based on actual political science research
- Creates appropriate correlations between variables
- Includes sufficient sample sizes for meaningful analysis
- Generates data with realistic noise and variation

To regenerate all synthetic datasets:
```r
source("data/generate_basic_datasets.R")
```

## Loading Data in Exercises

All exercises should load data using:
```r
library(tidyverse)
data_name <- read_csv("data/filename.csv")
```

## Dataset Documentation

Each dataset includes:
- Realistic variable names and ranges
- Appropriate correlations for teaching concepts
- Sufficient complexity for advanced exercises
- Clear variable meanings for student interpretation
- Sample sizes appropriate for statistical power

## Notes for Instructors

- Real datasets provide authenticity and connection to actual research
- Synthetic datasets are designed specifically for pedagogical clarity
- All datasets work together to build concepts progressively across weeks
- Variable naming is consistent across related datasets
- Missing data is minimal to focus on core concepts rather than data cleaning
